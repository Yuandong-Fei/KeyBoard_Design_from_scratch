# KeyBoard_Design_from_scratch

keyboard design from scratch

Day 1
  Based on the goal I want to achieve before I head off to my university, I listed several things that need to be done

1. electonic board
2. the aluminum cut out for the keys
3. programming the keyboard into several modes: normal, gaming and programming.
4. switches: green, orange and red
5. stabalizers
6. maybe arduino for the extra functionality
7. RGB lighting


Day 2
  PCB skills are required for designing the curcuit board that supports the software and the keys
  Design PCB circuit boards using Altium Designer, which operatres in windows and requires C# .
